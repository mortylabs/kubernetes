# kubernetes

Here you'll find the yaml manifests for my k3s homelab. 

To learn kubernetes, I chose to write the raw yamls myself rather than blindly deploy over-complicated helm charts that someone else has published. This is hands-down the best way to learn and appreciate the inner workings of kubernetes deployments :)
