# kubernetes

Here you'll find the yaml manifests for my k3s homelab. To learn kubernetes. I've chosen to write the raw yamls myself rather than blindly deploy over-complicated helm charts that someone else has written so that I could learn and appreciate the inner workings of kubernetes manifests. I want to understand what is going on :)
